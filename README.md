# Global-Adventures-Map ðŸŒŽ
A web page featuring a map of locations I've visited!

## Motivation
I love maps. So I wanted a super simple project to play with a great looking library, Leaflet JS. To learn the basics of the library, I decided to make an interactive map of places that I've visited with vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.
